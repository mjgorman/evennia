## Creating an Issue

Thanks for helping us improve Evennia! Please use one of the issue templates below:

 * [Issue/Bug report template][A] - when you have an error, problem or unexpected behavior to report. Note that pure usage questions belong on the [mailing list][5] or in the [chat][6].
 * [Feature request template][B] - when you have an idea for a new Evennia feature.
 * [Documentation error template][C] - when you find an error in the [documentation][2]. Please note that the documentation is a wiki, so consider if you can easily fix the problem yourself first.
 * [Empty template][D] - for issues not covered by the other templates, like long-term tasks and reminders.

If you want to contribute code to Evennia, you should work in your own Github *fork* (see our [style guide](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/blob/master/CODING_STYLE.md)) and then make a *pull request*. Read the [Contribution][3] page for instructions how. 

## Formatting your Issue

Issues are formatted using [markdown][7]. Here is some useful markdown syntax:

   - \**italic text*\* 
   - \*\***bold text**\*\* 
   - \[link text\]\(url\)
   - \``inline code`\` 
   - \`\`\````multiline code```\`\`\`

Please use \``@command`\` when you mention Evennia in-game commands starting with `@`. Otherwise github will notify any github-user that happens to be named *command*.

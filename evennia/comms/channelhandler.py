"""
The channel handler, accessed from this module as CHANNEL_HANDLER is a
singleton that handles the stored set of channels and how they are
represented against the cmdhandler.

If there is a channel named 'newbie', we want to be able to just write

    newbie Hello!

For this to work, 'newbie', the name of the channel, must be
identified by the cmdhandler as a command name. The channelhandler
stores all channels as custom 'commands' that the cmdhandler can
import and look through.

> Warning - channel names take precedence over command names, so make
sure to not pick clashing channel names.

Unless deleting a channel you normally don't need to bother about the
channelhandler at all - the create_channel method handles the update.

To delete a channel cleanly, delete the channel object, then call
update() on the channelhandler. Or use Channel.objects.delete() which
does this for you.
